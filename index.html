<br>Novoročný Hovor so Smaďom do Podhájskej.
<br><br>
<br>Hike to Suicide Cliff.
<br><br>
<br>Started reading a new book.
<br>First thing it made me think about was that whenever there is a disruption caused by more empathic system, existing leaders tend to protect their market until they miss the wave (personal computing, digital cameras, music streaming, ride sharing, Airbnb)
<br><br>
<br>Ľudia sa boja robiť zložité zmeny.
<br>Radšej chcú byť lepší o 5 percent o mesiac ako o 500 percent o 5 rokov.
<br>Prvá cesta je responzívna - riešiť problémy, ktoré sú predo mnou, druhá proaktívna - budovať vecí, ktoré neexistujú
<br>Len veľmi málo ľudí myslí dlhodobo.
<br>--
<br>iPhone release - Microsoft laughing, it has no keyboard
<br>Would you recognize disruption?

<br>Hike to Suicide Cliff.
<br>V pláne je aj vrátiť sa naspäť
<br><br>
<br>-There we go. 2020!
<br><br>
<br>I use Instagram as a tool to improve my photography skills. The only way is through keeping consistency and raising quality bar.
<br>To ensure that I set a goal for 2019 - to reach 500 posts on @mareksiv and @letoslav.
<br>This is my 2019 report
<br>Mareksiv 161
<br>Letoslav 338
<br>Total: 499
<br>Goal for 2020:
<br>500 posts; not one less!
<br><br>
<br>Krajiny, ktoré som navštívil v 2019, zoradené podľa dĺžky pobytu
<br>Hong Kong

<br>Error state handling.
<br>Levi, want to follow up on discussion on hike - I wonder when system is down if we offer any empathetic way to inform user
<br>-offline logic to handle that
<br>-when system uˇis down how to we tell that user in apps - any error state or just infinite lodaer
<br>--
<br>How can user easily detect
<br>--
<br>Show empathy withusers when system is down
<br>-show them in a warm way we understand inconveniences we caused - do more than Try again later
<br>-needs to be an offline logic we hich handles states when app cannot connect to system.
<br>-shared properly implemented(empty states are commonly as default, overlaid with data after loaded - that's wrong and lazy implementation)
<br>-use aniˇation (eg driver waiting on red light) - need to come to the scene at when high confidence system is down - cannot be misused
<br>-help user inform when system is back - link to status page
<br>—
<br>Scale this logic . Multiply in other instances to ceeate a new generatoon of emathetic communication with customer

<br>The smallest thing that brought an overwhelming outcome I did in 2019 was to uninstall Facebook app from my phone.
<br>Soon after I did that, I found out that I've got much more free time. I have more time in the morning, in the evening before going to bed and I finish my meals faster.
<br>I invest saved time into reading.

<br>We’ve got an offer on desk from Grab to buy operations (customer base, not the app)
<br>A: That guy believes he can build something in China and export it to the world.
<br>Whats stopping you from that? 
<br>Why you’re keeping your office in Hong Kong?
<br><br>
<br>That you are hongkonger and your company is local - from Hong Kong
<br><br>
<br>Because you are sentimental. Not because you are stupid, but because you are human
<br>B: That guy wants to focus on building business in China. Why else yould you launch a new app which can be easily rebranded?
<br>How would you feel to become a product manager at Grab?

<br>I talked to engineers and they confirmed me there is no proper way to handle outage states
<br><br>
<br>Airtable bases 
<br>Rather than finding right answer let's have some rules which will lead to desired state and enforce them
<br>1. Set up ownership - whenever there is unclear ownership upon things, they become unmaintained
<br>-each base has an owner. If you need a base for your work, you are an owner and you are responsible for maintaining it. 
<br>-If you are owner you put your name on things you own. 
<br>-Each base has only one owner. If there is multiple people using the same board, they decide who will be owner
<br>-if you are owner and don't find your base useful for yourself any more, you can archive it
<br>-if you are owner and you don't find base useful for yourself any more but someone else does, you transfer ownership (and that person becomes an owner)
<br>-if no one claims ownership over a base, it will be archived
<br>-if you are owner you are responsible for bases you own. Bases you own are accessible for everyone and as an owner you need to make sure everyone can understand and use its data (eg documentation, consistent terminology and structure)
<br>-as an owner you work with other owners to make sure your boad is well documented, uses consistent terminology and structure
<br>-as an owner you are not only responsible for mastering your bases but you need to make sure these rules are applied to all bases
<br>--
<br>Same thinking which is applied for everyone
<br>Investigate root problem, not do what you are asked for - how to maintain bases
<br>Propose system that handle that with low effort and scales up easily - handle 3 boards as easy as 100 transferrable to another systems

<br>Tam som končil aj minulý týždeň, tentokrát na inom mieste, bližšie k vrcholu. Dĺžka bola ďaleko dlhšia ako naposledy a strmých úsekov bolo niekoľkonásobne viac a väčšinou brutálne dlhé.

<br>Its a great improvement and I like your approch of pushing things live instead of perfecting on staging. I would be careful about blemishes in UI. Although its a minor thing compared to the scope of the update, when interface doesnt look or behave as user expects, it can undermine trust. On mobile I saw some components leaving too much white space on left or duplicated images in marketing pages.
<br>Product updates can be zero cost opportunity to engage community and get extrenal inputs

<br>Meditation and prayer help maintain a healthy spirit. Spirit is not a ghost—it is your inner person or inner being. Yes, your spirit is as real as YOU and if you don’t believe it, try this:
<br>*What happens when someone dies? What is it that departs from a person?*
<br>The person’s life—right?
<br>That’s what I mean. I know some people will disagree, but that is a story for another day.
<br>Anyway, meditation and prayer builds a healthy spirit and increases your faith, which in turn builds a healthy mind, which builds a healthy body.

<br>-When you ask questions you are thinking about the problem

<br>Playing ukulele this morning.
<br>Obervoming a huge bias set by brain - ulyou use two hands simultaneously. Left hand presses chords and ringh one does strumming. What brain does. When you mess up a chord, it pulls emergency break and everything stops until you fix it. You need to teach your brain that right hand plays independently from left hand. If left hand messes up a chord, right one keeps strumming. 
<br>It’s learning a new skill and there is a capacity in your brain you need to unlock to achieve that.

<br>First of all: i found it difficult to work on flows. We were focused on interfaces and this was distracting from understanding reslations between them - uis like expedition, booking, something what happens next, profiles, likes, discussions, and other exciting parts we have discussed seemed as isolted nodes floating in vacuum.
<br>I found to find it difficult to explain value of pages we are working on - its because we are focused to much on appearance. To be able to see connections we need to change the way we see them
<br>To build a world class product we need to see motivations and needs of the customer first. Inferfacws are nothing more than their reflection, not the other way around.
<br>Because of lack of connection Traditional process for building flows doesnt work for this - takes our attention to interfaces - when we see user browsing expeditions - we tend to forrget what brought them there
<br>Difficult to be explain particular stages on user flow
<br>Created states of commectedness
<br>-all flows are related. Places like booking page, prifile, - want to go are states on a bigger picture - you cannot think of one without considering others
<br>To remind that oursleves - we are not using There is no longer a booking page. We are no longer taking about dxpddition page
<br>There is only a state of connectedness - there are 5 degrees from inspire to pride - challenge is how to take customers to the final state
<br>When we are thinking a page to list out expeditions - we should always ask why we are doing that. How does this help user to move to the next state
<br>What we call Booking is a interface to convey that state
<br><br>
<br>What empathy are we using - any idea should be challenged by questioning
<br><br>
<br>We can succeed if we master every single stage
<br><br>

<br>Why?
<br>-adaptivity. Second path tales more risk: requires handling tougher tasks, getting skills and knowlesge we dont have
<br>-I have dofferent habits in HK and SK. Its like I’ve got two personalities sith their own routines and habits and I am switching between them. I couldnt bring my Slovak personality to HK, it would be too costly, so I left it there and created an new one which is adopted to a new environment. 
<br>I found many people wouldnt be able to do that and they wouldnt be able to live on different place for a longer time
<br>-working long term means adapting to conditions that do not exist. Means thinking and living in new ways, dropping your old self - thats why its so problematic for many.

<br>Už Thúkydidés si všiml, že země obklopené mořem se v mnoha ohledech liší od pevninských mocností. Klasickým příkladem takových států byly Sparta a Athény. Athény čerpaly svou sílu z obchodu a řemesel, Sparta z tradičního rolnictví. Z geografických a ekonomických rozdílů vyplývaly i rozdíly politické a kulturní. Athény byly otevřenou demokracií cenící si individuální svobody, Sparta naproti tomu kolektivistickou a konzervativní oligarchií. Toto schéma se mělo opakovat po celé dějiny a jeho posledním příkladem byla rivalita mezi přímořskými Spojenými státy a pevninským Sovětským svazem.

<br>Jestliže Rusko nedokáže ovládnout celý kontinent, a vše nasvědčuje tomu, že nedokáže, bude muset udělat vše pro to, aby Eurasie na západě hraničila se spřáteleným blokem vedeným Německem. Polsko se tak musí rozhodnout pro vstup do ruské nebo německé sféry zájmů, v opačném případě na ně čeká tentýž osud jako obvykle. „Středoevropská civilizace je příliš slabá na to, aby vydržela napětí mezi Východem a Západem. Země tohoto regionu se musejí jasně rozhodnout: buďto tam, nebo tam. Polsko-litevská civilizace se nedokázala nebo nemohla jasně vyslovit, proto musela zmizet. Je to samozřejmě dramatická situace.

<br>Goal should be to provide the simplest way to expess how amazing foundlost expeditions are
<br>Rethink medium - what is the most convenient way to create and consume?
<br>Think of audiobooks, podcasts vs printed books - skipping -> extraction, get to points of interest
<br>Export meaningful parts
<br>Lets create inspiring people - share their stories
<br>—expedition diary might be a way — to tell this is how expedition where I was part of went
<br>— needs to ve as simple as sharing photos — vidual diary —0ut some photos to each day — what photos reflect the entire expedition the most? — what were the highlishts?
<br>Start with CS and CH — ask him to pick photos that reflect the mood of the trip - design for emotionality, not rationality - and work with him to find the most capturing way of storytelling
<br>—later on, enable everyone to come and share their moments — great content validates standard of foundlost expeditions
<br>—Create a community sharing their stories. 
<br>Anyine can come and create their posts - you come to us give us your photos and se will help you to publish them in a stunning way you can share
<br>—we encourage you to post moments related to outdoor experiences, but not stopping you from posting about anything you want.  Warm Reminder, there is community and they might be in related posts - less related posts may receive less exposure - you need to start thinking of ramkings and segments to make sure right content will be delivered to right people. Not a concern for day 0

<br>In the middle of Wuhan Flu panic.
<br><br>
<br>Slovenská vláda je pri Wuhan Flu optimistická. Podľa ich stanoviska je všetko v pohode, je to vpodstate stále len chrípka, ľudia by mali cvičiť, jesť ovocie a vyhnú sa jej. Keby aj nie, tak žiadne prípravy sa nekonajú, takže by mali smolu.
<br><br>
<br>Celkom ma prekvapuje ako sa ten čierny mor v Európe zľahčuje
<br>Prirovnáva sa ku chrípke, fakty sa prekrúcajú tak, aby vírus vyznel miernejšie ako SARS.
<br>Bez akejkoľvek kritiky sa používajú čínske štatistiky - pri nich sa ľudia dohadujú, koľko núl treba k číslam, ktoré uvádzajú, dopísať (podľa niektorých modelov do dvoch týždňoch má byť nakazených 250k ľudí, oficiálne čísla uvádzajú vyše 1000, keď bol vírus v 10 krajinách a HK hlásil 60 podozrivých, Čína oficiálne okolo 80 - toľko k dôveryhodnosti)
<br>Celkovo sa vytvára dojem, že žiadna hrozba nehrozí a keby náhodou hej, Čína má situáciu pod kontrolou (kolujú videá z čínskych nemocníc, kde na to zomierajú ľudia ako muchy, príbehy o biedej až žiadna starostlivosti)

<br>Smaďo sa ma pýta na čínsky vírus:
<br>Predstav si vírus, v ktorom sa spájajú dve vlastnosti
<br>1. Je vysoko smrteľný a neexistuje naňho žiadna protilátka
<br>2. Veľmi ľahko sa prenáša z človeka na človeka. Stačí aby niekto vedľa teba zakašlal a hneď si chorý aj ty. Pri tomto víruse sa príznaky prejavia až po dvoch týždňoch, medzitým ho človek šíri okolo seba bez toho, že by o tom vedel
<br><br>
<br>Preto tá panika. Ďalšia vec, never oficiálnym číslam. Ľudia, čo to sledujú,  sa hadaju koľko núl treba za ne dopísať. Podľa niektorých ľudí v teréne môže byť teraz nakazených štvrť milióna
<br><br>
<br>A to je o dosť viac ako tých pár tisícok čo sa uvádza. Jedna vec je, že nie všetky prípady sú hlásené. V Číne ich je toľko že nemajú kapacity každého ošetriť a ludi posielajú domov bez toho aby sa na nich niekto pozrel
<br><br>

<br>Na raňajky zvyknem jesť chleba natretý džemom. Francúzsky čučoriedkový džem je celkom dobrý a nie je doňho pridaný žiadny cukor. Dosladzovany je šťavou z ďatlí a hrozna.
<br>Prvýkrát v živote som si kupoval džem. Doteraz som si nosil džemy od našich. Keď sa mi minulú, povedal soˇ si, že keď už kúpiť dzem tak taký, ktorý doma nemáme. Tak som kúpil čučoriedkový s kúskami čučoriedok a bez cukru.
<br>Rovnako som rozmyslal aj keď som kupoval med. Kúpil som španielsky pomarančový med.
<br>Dal som si záležať aj na chrbte. 
<br>Ľudia v Hong Kongu nerozumejú chlebu. 
<br>Anglické mäkké štvorcové pláty nie sú chleba. Chuti do dobre len keď sa zapečie.
<br>Inak naposledy som si kúpil tmavý ražný bavorský chlieb.

<br>Last year I recovered from pneumonia. It was not fun and it took me more than two months to fully recover.
<br>I found out that I partially caused taking it so long by myself - I was rushing things. I wanted to get back to work as soon as possible.
<br>Since then I am super careful about myself. There is no work more important than your health. Even if you were a founder. 
<br>Working from home has low impact on my productivity. It's a fair response to the current situation and there is no reason to feel guilty.

<br><br>
<br>Ako investovať
<br>Exchange rates.
<br>Balík 50k, presúvať z meny do meny. Sledovať pohyby, predať, keď je hore, kúpiť, keď je mena dole. Raz do týždňa presuva, keď má vysokú istotu.
<br>Keby mal viac času, presuva každý deň a zarobí 10 krát viac.
<br>-
<br>Currencies preto, lebo sú regulované. Krypto nie sú
<br>--
<br>Stocks
<br>Plat v Lalajobe si zarobí rovnako aj na financiách.
<br>Revolut na investovanie - žiadny problém - rob to isté s akciami - jedným klikom
<br>Kupuj US.
<br>Kým je Trump v bielom dome, ekonomiku chráni. Nech je aký chce.
<br>Never Číne.
<br>Keď zablokovali HK letisko, kúpil som akcie SZ. Do pár hodín išli hore.
<br>Firmy si vyberaj podľa toho čo na nej nájdeš. Verejné informácie ti dajú spoľahlivý obraz - CEO sa často meni - zlý signal. CEO rezignoval - red flag
<br>Pozri Glassdoor - co na nich ľudia hovoria.
<br>Rozpoznanie bubliny - amazon vystrelil - pozri na trendy, čoskoro budú akcie naspäť v normále
<br>Ako sú spokojný s manažmentom.
<br>Manažment v LLM je neschopný, tým by som neveril.x
<br>Ľahšie odhalis negatívne znaky ako pozitívne
<br>-
<br>Stocks and currencies - enough to make enough for living - read the book I gave you to understand finances - it opened my eyes
<br>-
<br>Then combine knowledge with experience you build
<br><br>
<br>Networking
<br>Opportunity to unlock new opportunities- ones you cannot think of
<br><br>
<br>If everybody leaves it may be a fair response.
<br>Your action brings reaction brings reaction
<br>If you don't treat your talent with respect, you will lose it
<br>It will move somewhere and C-players will stay because you create an environment where they can hide.
<br>Autonomous teams working in cultures endorsing leadership are the most powerful thing for cussessful companies
<br>--
<br>Don't hesitate to leave if it's time. You have been warned
<br>If you stay, your workload increase and it makes hard for you to leave later
<br>-
<br>Before they add you workload, ask to get compensated for effort they are asking you to put in. you cannot renegotiate terms if train is moving
<br>If you ask and they say no, you can also say no.

<br>Piatok.
<br><br>
<br>Korona vírus.
<br><br>
<br>Čísla s úmrtnosťou sú zavádzajúce, lebo sa počítajú na vzorke všetkých pacientov. Čiže keď sa choroba rozširuje, čísla zdanlivo nízke. Keď sa pozrieme na uzavreté pripady, tak nám to poskytne lepší prehľad o tom, ako sa s tým jednotlivé krajiny dokážu vysporiadať.
<br><br>
<br>Netvrdím, že treba podliehať panike, ale dôležité je prijímať proaktívne opatrenia.
<br><br>
<br>Rozdiel medzi podcenením a precenenim situácie je len v počte nakazených. Zatiaľ sú čísla v Európe celkom nízke, ale situacia sa môže veľmi rýchlo otočiť. Vírus sa objavuje aj na miestach kde by ho ešte pred pár týždňami nikto nečakal a hlásia ho aj malé dediny vzdialené od hlavných miest.
<br><br>
<br>Dôležité je nezabúdať, že vírus neohrozuje len vás, ale aj ľudí vo vašom okolí. Aj keď možno nepatríte do rizikovej skupiny, môžete ním ohroziť iných. V Hong Kongu sa stretla jedna rodina pri večeri a z niekoľkohodinového stretnutia sa nakazilo 10 ľudí, od malých detí, až po prababky.
<br><br>
<br>Keď sme s Kawai objednávali masky, nikto nevedel kam to až zájde. Z Číny presakovali chýry o nejakej záhadnej chorobe, keď sme objednávali také množstvo masiek, čo by bežne vystačilo aj na dva roky.
<br><br>
<br>Ak sa k ziadnym maskam neviete dostať, pošleme vám zopár z Hong Kongu pre prípad, že ich naozaj budete potrebovať

<br>trend is a market condition of the price action moving in one evident direction for a prolonged period of time
<br><br>
<br>Such traders always buy when the market is going up and sell when the market is going down. They usually miss the beginning of a trend, never trading at the tops and bottoms, because their systems require confirmation that the new swing in fact resulted in the development of a new trend, rather than being just a pullback within the old trend.

<br>Trend following strategies, when followed correctly of course, are the safest and arguably the most profitable trading strategies out there.

<br>When facing a crisis, I try to distinguish *what I can control and what I cannot.* For those I cannot, I will not worry or even care about it. For those I can control, I go all in. 
<br>This mentality was trained during my poker years. In Texas hold’em, luck is the major component in the short-term. Sometimes you will lose although you play well. On the contrary, you can win even if you play badly. Texas hold’em is a game that relies on luck in short-term but technique in long-term. 
<br>However, the difficult part is when you continuously lose money for days or even weeks, you will start to doubt your own competence and even question if God is against you. How did I come through the down times? It's simply by looking at what I believe I can control and what I cannot.
<br>Obviously, *my poker swing can’t begin to compare with the magnitude of this crisis, but I believe the same principle applies*. We will focus on what we can do, and trust that time and efforts, will deliver us out of this crisis.

Waking up in early morning gives you a chance to watch darkness fading out and objects getting to appear from disappearing night. There can be so much beauty about freezing cold winter or scorching summer.

<br>Jackie Kennedy , Crown
<br>-give them the face they want to see (social, shining) to protect your real one (shy, introvertial)
<br>-when in Paris, speak French, use their manners / give them a face of being one of them
<br>- You need to create a few faces and be able to switch between them.
<br>- Cannot use one only to deal with all life situations

<br>Foundlost
<br>- MS And CH looking at feedback in different ways. CH - how to tell stories? MS - how to deal with their interest?
<br>- CH- Can define principles but they don't make the job - give freedom, but also ambiguity - will never clearly the you what doing g wrong
<br>- MS Imagine a community where everyone is super excited - everyone you meet. You need to build barriers for entry. Like freelance work - selective for clients + quality, become attractive
<br>- Take suggestion - take what they like and multiply - show it and find limits
<br>--
<br>One website will not make all problem.s magically disappear

<br>Escape, Remoteness - because people want to disconnect, offline for a weekend- why not to try it in Myanmar?
<br>Time element - 3 days - spontaneousity - you don't need a lot planning
<br>Education - gives you something new - living like a local, adopting new ways of life

<br>Foundlost
<br>Authenticity 
<br>- if you don't talk about your customers, there is something wrong (Ms)
<br>- - the best companies I have seen spend their discussion upon user data. They are concerned when new evidence comes -- take your conversations from product to users -- that's what *customer centricity* is
<br>- See ourself talking what we should do - leaving customer from conversation - 90 of the time should be a discussion on what you have seen, not what you should do
<br>- 
<br>Foundlost
<br>Network rather than micromanagement
<br>-problems beyond mines and CH scope and skills
<br>-were will need help from rest of the team
<br>-we will tell the problem but don't tell the answer - we ask to find it -
<br>We cannot and won't manage the entire process
<br>But we want to ensure we start from the same ground - customer data 
<br>>>Know that are big and its not managable by myself to solve them - need flat network rather than hierarchy
<br><br>
<br>Staying authentic - cannot work without empathy - concern about customer experience
<br><br>
<br>Abstracting research was definitely a challenge

<br>If you fail them once, can't convince this time it's great because I refined the story
<br><br>
<br>Change the game
<br>Take a step back from expedition
<br>You have a room where ongoing conversation happens
<br>Hey winter in Mongolia is super hard. Nomads need to migrate hundreds kilometers to take their herds to pastures
<br>What if you could try to live like a nomad,with everything it means - leading sheep, hunting, preparing food
<br>Would you be interested
<br>-
<br>Gather audiences based on causes, curiosity to learn more, follow a journey
<br>-
<br>You can manage their interest without giving them any promise
<br>-
<br>Create a clubs of cool people following cool stories
<br>If you connect with most passionate people you can ask what would be the best time for most of them - to increase chances of expedition
<br>-
<br>Validate stories before commitment
<br>Create exclusivity - hey you were one of the first followers of this - we want to offer you this

<br>This is my situation - my family needs me and I'm going to Italy.

<br>Inviting instead of hiding

<br>-enviromental cause - disappearing culture
<br>-ypu will get behind the scenes storie - what was promised, how it went - you read them - oh this was so cool - (thinking of Jakob talking about Myanmar)
<br>-now we tell: this is not all - explorers will keep sharing their stories >> articles, miniposts - they have great stories, we offer them a place to share them if they want
<br>--we will also tell stories that involve them
<br>-favotite this expedition in order not to miss them out
<br>--why it's great - because you'll meet people like you
<br><br>
<br>All these people are not too different to you
<br>--
<br>Chris blog - you find it meaningful, when he posts, you don't want to miss out -- 
<br>-- you will discover people and stories only a few klicks away
<br>--when these people have something to say we will remind you
<br>--there is some level of intimacy between you and author - there is some intimacy in posts - sharing what they learnt, how they got changed
<br>-relive, learn
<br>--i can see that these people are not different from me - if they can make it, I can make it too
<br>-i found a place which gives me confidence - now I can experience details - YouTube travel or food videos
<br>-- aa --
<br>Stories can retell the authentic experiences
<br>- Give something RAW
<br>-talks about uncomfortable experiences - humanize 
<br>-when you are talking about your story to someone - you are taking them to relive it 
<br>-difference connection - for more stories - expedition as following hashtag - one click connection
<br>-subscribe to more similar stories - anytime there is something new, you are notified
<br><br>
<br>- Make it super easy to connect - zero effort to subscribe
<br><br>
<br>Challenge - talking about something that doesn't exist and solves problems which are not clearly defined
<br><br>
<br>Create a vision that connects to problem your customers have
<br><br>
<br>Statements from future
<br>-now I believe I can make it
<br>-i cannot miss this out

<br>Help to book and discover - bookmark - to connect with meaningful pieces
<br><br>
<br>How can you help me to discover the most meaningful experiences?
<br>-expeditions
<br>-stories
<br><br>
<br>Don't overfocus with CTA too much
<br>-offer as a way to say author thank you for a great post
<br>- Human aspect - someone put sweat and tears to share those thoughts and hours into creating post - clicking on like a saying thank you
<br>- Emphasize to make platform invisible
<br>- -- still works well to self select by interest
<br>- Clicking on like is becoming a part of community
<br><br>
<br>To Author
<br>-we help you to see yourself in places and situations you haven't seen yourself before - 
<br><br>
<br>Problem - what's their problem
<br>Think how to serve them better
<br>-help them to connect with great experiences
<br>--from foundlost, from community /expeds, vs stories
<br>-showing a person they may become - prioritizing great pieces of content

<br>Jesus
<br>I told him I have another offer from.Shanghai
<br>I was very transparent and asked what should I do
<br>-he said. Ask yourself what do you want to do? How do you want to see your life in 5 years from now?
<br>And I knew I wanted to work with him.
<br><br>
<br>-you should be more specific about your future goals
<br>You don't give any value if you are unclear about yourself
<br>Of course, your priorities will change
<br>But your meaning should be the same
<br>-
<br>People tell me they want to start business. But they don't do anything for that
<br><br>
<br>-when I was 20 I wanted to fuck as many girls as possible. I still like girls but my goals are different
<br>-this food we eat is 6-7. I want to get on top. I want to eat food which is 9 and more
<br><br>
<br>-
<br>MS get comfortable with challenge.
<br>I bought a new phone on the same week I got drunk.
<br>I was drinking absinth and when I was on the way home... Suddenly I was standing in the completely random part of my time, in industrial area, far from home. And my telephone was gone. I lost it and never found it. It was so stupid.
<br>Ok, you fucked that up. Not for the first time and *certainly not for the last time.* 
<br>I wanted to give myself a lesson I never forget. I could buy a new phone anythine
<br>Deal was - no work money will be used. Need to find new sources.
<br>And I did
<br>Started building own apps which some of them became successful
<br>Cryptocurriences were starting - very little trust at that time, a lot of risk - could explode anytime - security, governments being disrupted - forced to explorer that - bought my first bitcoins when they cost 100
<br>-
<br>After a few months I bought a new phone
<br>-Nothing of that would happen if I was happy with status quo
<br>- It worked for me and it worked many other times
<br>- Many times I found myself questioning if I am doing right thing - saw friends complaining about quality of their lives but at the same time barriers of doing things differently were making them ok with conventional life
<br>- I am seeking a constant challenge for be because I am aware of sideefectsbit can bring
<br><br>
<br>Next week I am working from home
<br>-for coming 7days there is a special selection of alcohol(stout, IPA, cider), cheese (rablechaunt, goat cheese) and smoked ham (Parma ham) ready
<br><br>

<br>Three ways to create value
<br>1. Execution - actively creating something
<br>2. Planning - thinking how to deliver more value in future that I would be able do do now, includes research
<br>3. Learning - investments into skills, so i can offer more value within the same resources or achieve something i cannot now
<br>-Can be active - studying materials
<br>-Giving challenge, getting myself outside from comfort zone and when come back discover skills i didnt have before
<br>&if i wanted to improve my coordination with engineering, would it be ok to spend my capacities into learning code? I could also understand how they see myslef from their angle
<br>&same question, different skill - is it ok to work on personal project - becoming better leader, better product, better designer?
<br>There is a value I am bringing back
<br>--
<br>Its normal to have free capacities
<br>Its stupid to invest them into uncreative zero value tasks only to show people you are doing some work
<br>-What matters is how you deal with your free time
<br>Ok, what should i do?

<br>- How would finished expedition look like? How about new expedition - what do you expect people to do?

<br>Ekonomická globalizácia sa podľa neho postupne preklopí do trendu, ktorému hovorí „relokalizácia“. Teda opätovné naviazanie množstva komplexnej výroby na konkrétnu lokalitu.
<br><br>
<br>ekonomicky výhodné bude, aby globálne putovali najmä znalosti, nie polotovary a súčiastky.
<br><br>
<br>Centrálna stranícka politika nemá znalosti ani motivácie, a už vôbec nie presvedčenie ako vyrovnávanie regiónov a lokalít stimulovať. To je vecou autonómnych, sebestačných a nestraníckych miestnych samospráv, v spolupráci s národnou podnikateľskou (nie oligarchickou) sférou. Všetka ekonomika a hospodársky pohyb začína vždy v lokalite, nikdy nie na ministerstve.
<br><br>
<br>„Zaměstnanecká mentalita“? Tá je predsa následok, nie príčina. Česi i Slováci odjakživa boli, sú a budú podnikateľmi. Jediné, čo z nich môže urobiť námezdníkov a zamestnancov je zlá stranícka politika centra, zlé monokultúrne vzdelávanie, a nadmieru dobre premazané brzdy k budúcnosti, samostatnosti a individuálnemu úspechu talentovaných ľudí mladších generácií.
<br><br>
<br>spôsob baťovskej produkcie, teda čo najbližšie k zákazníkovi, musí prevládnuť.
<br>Relokalizácia nie je o jednej lokalite, ale o mnohých lokalitách, produkujúcich, spolupracujúcich a doplňujúcich sa.

<br>Would be much easier to give them a link or Qr code to a page with my public profile where they can leave their email.
<br>They request would appear in my list
<br>This way I would crowdsource the effort - I would have a complete set of people who matter  without figuring out their most approachable email address. (Going to Gmail and finding the most appropriate one) - want to get the list done quickly, but takes effort
<br>This virtual handshake (offering a hand and accepting) Furthermore everyone would give me a permission to send email.
<br>Those most avid ones would receive an invite back from me with the first letter send / the sooner I send my first letter the sooner they can get invited to use

<br>It is a general rule that the US dollar normally weakens when the price of oil increases, because if the dollar is weaker, more US dollars must be converted into other currencies to buy the same amount of oil as before. In turn, expensive oil means that the Canadian dollar will likely strengthen due to the close ties between the Canadian dollar and the price of oil.

<br>Habits are algorithms operating in the background that power our lives. Good habits help us reach our goals more effectively and efficiently. Bad ones makes things harder or prevent success entirely. Habits powerfully influence our automatic behavior.
<br>-
<br>building a single habit can have a wider impact on our lives. Duhigg calls these keystone habits. These are behaviors that cause people to change related areas of their lives. For example, people who start exercising daily may end up eating better and drinking less. Likewise, those who quit a bad habit may end up replacing it with a positive alternative.
<br>build a habit is to start small. Once these become ingrained, the degree of complexity can be increased. If you want to read more, you can  [start with 25 pages a day](https://fs.blog/2015/12/twenty-five-pages-a-day/) .

<br>Athlete Eliud Kipchoge makes notes after each training session to establish areas which can be improved.
<br><br>
<br>Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your *own biases*. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored.”
<br>—Ray Dalio
<br><br>
<br>First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it - bad sign if you see people at superior positions here
<br>we look for something that *only solves the immediate problem without considering the consequences.*
<br>-
<br>*The road to out-thinking people can’t come from first-order thinking*. It must come from second-order thinking*. Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can’t see.*
<br>-
<br>Improving ability to think
<br>-ask: and then what? Explore consequences, short or long term
<br>-how would other parts of ecosystem respond?
<br>-
<br>A lot of extraordinary things in life are the result of things that are *first-order negative, second order positive.* So just because things look like they have no *immediate payoff, doesn’t mean that’s the case*. All it means is that you’ll have less competition if the second and third order consequences are positive because everyone who thinks at the first order won’t think things through.
<br>-
<br>Second-order thinking takes a lot of work. It’s not easy to think in terms of systems, interactions, and time. However, *doing so is a smart way to separate yourself from the masses.*

<br>straw man argument will focus on an irrelevant or unimportant detail, selecting the weakest part of the argument
<br>take some small part of an arguer’s position and then treat it as if that represented his larger position, even though it is not really representative of that larger position. It is a form of generalizing from one aspect to a larger, broader position, but not in a representative way.

<br>Hollow man argument
<br>Argument is attributed to a non-existent group.
<br>distracts attention away from the actual reasons
<br>Arguing against an opponent which doesn’t exist is a pretty easy way to win any debate. People who use hollow man arguments will often favor vague, non-specific language without explicitly giving any sources or stating who their opponent is.

<br>our perception of an opinion is not that opinion. The most useful thing we can do is attempt to see the territory.

<br>	1	You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”
<br>	2	You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
<br>	3	You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
<br>	4	Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
<br><br>
<br>debate is extremely important to us, the ideological Turing test can be a helpful tool for ensuring we’re fully prepared. Even if we can’t use it all the time, it can serve us well in high-stakes situations.

<br>I aˇ always ken to hear about custoˇer centric companies.
<br>Customer centric companies are unique by those cultures. While most of the companies is focused on execution (project based, getting things done), customer centric cultures are genuinely focused on soˇving problem of their customers. They put goals of their customers over goals of they business, because while most of the team think of quick questions, they think long terˇ and on long term horizon, goals of customers and business are aligned
<br>-
<br>I know Hong Kong may offer only few cultures like this. This is what I use as positive signs to recognize them
<br>-high customer loyalty, their customers are passionate and spread word of mouth
<br>-teams excited to talk about their customers, their problems, challenged they create from themselves to serve their customers better (execution driven teams talk about features/solutions, their business and market shares)
<br>-teams have backgrounds in other customer centric companies (Amazon, apple, Tesla,...)

<br>Ben, haven't heard from you for a while. Are you still with the team?
<br>I always enjoyed having you with team
<br>Have an advice for you. Maybe there is not much opportunities for you on short term, but there is always value you can offer in you think on long run.
<br>You can explore new ideas, just don't limit yourself to quick wins. Think of value for Foundlost community that will stay with company for years.
<br>You will lead the process thatbrings your idea to life when current short term tasks are completed, as long as you show confidence and convince team it's a right thing to do.
<br>Don't think inside the box and always strive to bring something to the table, something that no one has thought about. Only then you get get yourself into better position 
<br>I can give you an example from company I work. There were some structural changes and there was literally nothing to do for some months. While PMs in my team complained that they don't have any backlog and no tech team to manage - literally they couldn't show any value (now), I started doing research on problem I was passionate about and which was far from scope of my role.

<br>Deň, keď v dôsledku napadnutia Poľska Francúzsko a Veľká Británia vypovedali Hitlerovmu Nemecku vojnu, bol pre nemeckú generalitu jedným z najhorších. Nemeckí vojvodcovia očakávali rýchly spojenecký prielom cez chabo chránenú západnú hranicu na Rýne a rýchly kolaps tzv. Tretej ríše. Generáli sa dokonca začali pripravovať na vyjednávanie so Spojencami a prvým krokom malo byť odstránenie Hitlera.
<br>O to väčšie bolo prekvapenie, keď sa mohutná francúzska armáda obmedzila na kozmetický výpad do Sárska a spokojná sama so sebou sa po pár týždňoch stiahla do zákopov pri Maginotovej línii.

<br>Mal som šťastie, lebo hoci som o ňom vedel, nebol som nanho vôbec pripravený, no zrovna v najväčšej fáze ho prekryl mrak a zatmenie sa dalo veľmi jasne vidieť.
<br>Ďalšie bude v 2030.
<br><br>
<br>Nemecká armáda preto od začiatku pri výcviku kládla veľký dôraz na schopnosť dôstojníkov rozhodovať sa v boji samostatne, postupovať iniciatívne a nečakať odovzdane na rozkazy zhora.
<br>To bola výrazná odlišnosť oproti filozofii velenia ostatných armád. Ďalším nemeckým veľmi pokrokovým špecifikom bol intenzívny nácvik súčinnosti tankových a pechotných jednotiek navzájom, ale aj s letectvom.

<br>When you have Monopoly marketshare, company is not successful any more.

<br>-Tina told me she was working on freelance gig this weekend
<br>A year before was a turning point in my life.
<br>I started looking for to create challenge for me
<br>Saw myself growing through No situations - able to manage things impossible before
<br>Started looking for them
<br>It's like riding a bike. If you stop turning pedals, you stop. Faster you do, faster you go
<br>-
<br>I loved small teams and launching products because monster companies were turning into dinosaurs - slow to responding to market - legacy systems, vertical lawyers slowing decisions
<br>When they launch one thing small team with little resources can move faster if they are super focused
<br>--
<br>If you do things for the sake of doing things, you will stop sooner or later. You get yourself busy but you create new value
<br>Don't ask yourself what you can do for business, start with customer
<br>--
<br>It's a good skill to have to observe if you are moving.
<br>You may find yourself in place that doesn't move or find how to move faster - and have fun from that
<br>-
<br>Big corps are structured in way they demotivate their employees to take risks - they ideas are safe and to please business
