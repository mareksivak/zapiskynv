                Aj takým je dobre, čo svojim ničomným podujatiam, ba ešte aj náruživostiam dávajú honosné mená
                a vyhlasujú ich za ohromné činy prispievajúce k šťastiu a blahu ľudského pokolenia - šťastný, kto
                vie byť taký.

<br>- Mr. Marek, Happy New Year.
<br><br>
<br>Na checkine som stretol Martina a Cat. Koncom mesiaca budeme na pláži variť guláš.
<br><br>
<br>I am sure we will pick it up quick enough.
<br><br>
<br>Kawai. Volá mi, aby som vyťukal 2B a povedal mgoi höi mun.x

<br>I was compelled
<br>Use imagination of my students
<br>Work from local problem to remote problem to global problem.
<br>Place focused on social impact
<br>We need your imagination to invent the solutions - imagination is important than knowledge
<br><br>
<br>Last week I was sitting on plane travelling from Slovakia to Hong Kong. I made a list of items. Each item is super important to me and I want to finish them by the end of this month:
<br>- start selling on Amazon
<br>- talk to my girlfirend and plan the future of our relationship. / About some stuff 
<br>- help a friend to make a website for his personal project
<br>- organize another trip to Slovakia to attend friends wedding
<br>#.
<br><br>
<br>There are people who share their stories in such compelling way that you stop breathing as you listen to every single world they say.
<br>When I share my stories people usually stop paying attention after while.
<br>Once someone asked me, how I learnt to speak Chinese. Learning makes better.
<br>I started studying people. I watch comedians for presenting with confidence. I watch speakers on TED Talks sharing their ideas. I watch movies for constructing storylines and expressing emotions. I read posts from people with outstanding writing skills.
<br>I have started sharing my thoughts by doing simple excercise - write down one thing that you learnt today, or has stayed on your mind in the end of the day. Make it public - put your name on it, let everyone read it. Do it every day and see what happens after week, two weeks, month.
<br>#.
<br><br>
<br>I was inspired from my personal experience. A few months back I returned from Thailand. 
<br>I am selling things to help people solve their problems. I was inspired by my personal experience - I returned from a trip to Thailand and found it difficult to make a thai tea ...
<br><br>
<br>Languages hanve different world orders. Speaking in different word order is like driving on another side of road. And that's fun about learning a language.
<br>- 
<br>A word table has a femine gender in French. If you were asked to describe how it would speak, most French people would say it would speak in femine voice.
<br><br>
<br>Let Doha -> Hong Kong.
<br><br>
<br>- You are sitting in chair in the height of 10km, watching movies, eating food and drinking wine. How cool ist that?
<br><br>
<br>Kat hovorí, že filmy v lietadle vedia ušetriť na vstupnom do kina. Navyše je pri nich vidno, ako sú mnohé filmy precenené.
<br>Napríklad Deadpool 2
<br><br>
<br>Movie night:
<br>- Deadpool 2
<br>- Smallfoot
<br><br>
<br>Ranná káva nad Indiou
<br><br>
<br>I like flights. You are sitting on chair moving 1000km/hour, watching movies, eating food, drinking wine. How cool is that?

<br><br>
<br>Its not about tearing down old ideas, its about creating new ones.

<br><br>
<br>Will there be a recession in 2019?
<br>Don't incentivize consumers to stop buying! Buying creates jobs, creates industries, creates more money organically.
<br>-
<br>Anything that reduces consumer demand hurts the economy. Period.
<br>Higher taxes mean less people with demand to buy products
<br>Recession in the US occurs when -
<br>First someone on Wall Street comes up with a new way to make money.
<br>Then, a ton of money is made (sending the market to highs), then Wall Street goes ravenous with greed, then it comes crashing down and recession results.
<br>-
<br>Don't panic. Live your life. Kiss someone every day.
<br>- 
<br>There is no war affecting our economy, cryptocurrencies are Sillicon Valley invention and not Wall Street, and banks have been heavily regulated lately amd have no opportunities to go crazy.
<br><br>
<br>Selling on Amazon
<br>Basic stuff I can get at the supermarket. I learnt from personal experience I know that what's easy to get for me may be extremy frustrating to obtain by someone living somewhere else in the world.

<br>- made a protein bar in different way that others do. We didnt know if there is a market for it, but we know there are at least 3 people (us) who would buy it
<br>- sell on amazon (90 percent) and your website + build a strong social community
<br>- give them value. Be a step ahead (in past: are calories from fruits same as calories from meat? Now we are talking about nutrie ts impactimg our food sources - grass fed beef, plantation of plants)
<br>(Foundlost: others talk about experiences and exploration, talk about how it changes peoples lives on long term)

<br>- become rich: wife asked: are we going to celebrate? No, im going to worl, its part of my identity

<br><br>
<br>3 things I reduced in 2018
<br>-
<br>1. Checking social accounts. Checking updates in your feed creates a fake sense of productivity. No one wants to stay behind, but what portion of our days is wasted on pointless scrolling and seeking for excitement?
<br>2. Reading news. Stories you can find in news are biased and make everyone outraged. The more it bleeds, the more it reads. How many headlines you can read throughout a day are relevant week after? Staying away from news doesnt let you behind. Impprrant news will find a way to get to you anyway and you can do activoties with higher impact on your life, eg reading books.
<br>3. Drinking alcohol. Too many glasses make a different person of you. Then which oc these people is the real you? The one who you are in normal life or the one to whom you turn after some glasses? Furthermore, alcohol will make you look old.
<br>-
<br>Of course there's nothing wrong about drinking a glass of wine or opening facebook to check content created by your frienfs. Its more about finding a reasonable amount. The more you spent into fake rewards promised by social apps, news or alcohol, the worse you feel. There was no success ever built without discipline. The time you spend consuming can be turned into time invested into creating. Create something that gives value for someone. Help othe people to solve their problems. Share a story every day. Post a photo that inspires someone. In a year it will be 365 new stories. 
<br>You will start feeling being rewarded and your skills will incrementally graduate. 
<br>#
<br><br>
<br>I started posting on instagram 9 months ago. In real life I am a person who is quiet and keeps his thoughts for himself. Yku can be anyone in the virtual world and I wanted to push myself from my comfort zone.
<br>I created this account for 3 reasons:
<br>1. Learn photography. Anyone can take photos. How to share them in way that conveys a story? How to do that in way that is unique to you?
<br>2. Understand social media. I wanted to build something and create audience around that. I wanted to find what gives them value, how to interact with them and what can I takeaway from that
<br>3. Inspire. The true reward comes when someone gets impressed by my photos or leaves me thoughtful comment or encourages me in my work.
<br>##
<br><br>
<br>I have never believed in New Year's Resolutions. A vaguely defined goal timed to beginning of the year, hard to measure is doomed to fail. I always prefered small imcrements starting from "now".
<br>-
<br>Despite of that there is one resolution I have this year. 
<br>It is to make this account more personal. Even starting posting for imstagram was a challenge for me. For me as a queit person it was a big shift to keeptelling everyone with each post "hey, look here what i did".
<br>My next step is to share more thoughts which are going throug my head, and work on my writing and presentation skills.

<br>"Během studia vysoké školy se Peter zároveň v rámci programu Erasmus podíval do Amsterdamu, čímž se mu tak trochu otevřel svět".x
<br>.
<br>I krátká letní stáž může člověku otevřít obzory, změnit náhled na svět a posunout ho dále.
<br>.
<br>Z Peterova vyprávění je jasné, že se nebojí výzev. Spíše naopak. Mladý slovenský vývojář si uvědomil, že dokud bude nejchytřejší v místnosti, nikam se neposune. Zároveň vždy cítil potřebu dělat něco navíc a nad rámec běžných školních povinností. 
<br>.
<br>cítil, že v Silicon Valley na něj stále čekají kariérní příležitosti, které na Slovensku zkrátka nejsou. 
<br>Na druhou stranu cítil závazek k rodnému Slovensku, které mu poskytlo nejen bezplatné vzdělání, bez něhož by se do Silicon Valley nikdy nedostal. 
<br>.
<br>Práce v Silicon Valley pro Petera přeci jen znamená také možnost pracovat v multikulturním prostředí plném těch nejschopnějších lidí ve svém oboru. 
<br>.
<br>Peterův příběh je bezesporu inspirující a ukazuje, že kdo má odvahu, vůli dělat něco navíc a trpělivost zdokonalovat se v tom, co ho baví, může to dotáhnout opravdu daleko.

<br>What client really needs is help to identify what makes him different and what are his value props. 
<br>- I am not a good person for that. I can help people who already know it and to shape their ideas onto products they envision.
<br>- I know it because if they knew it they would made you excited for your idea.
<br>- This is a reason why I can't work on that. I tried that and it never went out well. Very negative for all

<br>You guys prefer to turn your ideas into well defined solutions. Lwe'll do that laterr and for now dream about perfect product. Lets think of ideal solution that would resolve all problems in the best way. We dont need to define every single detail of that. If we keep thinking about whats great, we can get to sometging that makes others excited and they will help us. This way we can create something bigger that we are caapble individually.x

<br><br>
<br>Yesterday night I went to a bookstore. I wanted to buy a book for J. It was soon before store closes. 
<br>I already knew which book I want to buy. I asked a lady where to quickly find it. After a while I was holding the book I wanted and waiting in a line at cashiers. 
<br>At the cashiers desk I noticed I noticed a history book about Hong Kong among some other featured books. 
<br>The announcement told that store will be closed in 10 mins and kindly asked customers to finish their purchases.
<br>I left the line to quickly take a look. It was a set of colorized photos telling stories from colonial times from Hong Kong's early days to its golden age.
<br>The photos were so eye catching that I could spend watching for hours on each and envision myself being a part of stories from decades ago. Colors brought them to although only focal parts of photographs were colorized.
<br>Another announcement reminded that store will be closed in 5 mins.
<br>I wanted to speed up my pace to briefly explore more chapters of the book. But the photos were so stunning that i couldnt move faster than one by one. I didnt want to miss out anything
<br>Finally the last announcement told that the time is up. I was still at the first pages. I closed the book and got back to the line and purchased the  book I came for.

<br>Try to do things you're incapable of.
<br>I started freelancing because I had no option.
<br>I was scared. I didn't know how to make client things what they wanted. I didnt know how to clarify their expectations and determine a way that leads there. I didn't know how to talk about price for my work and how to renegotiate it if scope of my work got changed. I was scared to talk to them.
<br>Having no one to solve your problems pushes you to look for ways by yourself. 
<br>Finally, I have worked with amazing people working on amazing things. I helped them to translate their visions into tangible products. We have identified problems and worked on solutions. I am proud of our projects. I am proud of our results that are much better than i would thought I am capable of doing.

<br>Relativity is the idea that an observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part. For example, a man inside an airplane does not feel like he is experiencing movement, but an outside observer can see that movement is occurring. This form of relativity tends to affect social systems in a similar way.

<br>Leverage
<br>Archimedes, “Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world.” With a small amount of input force, we can make a great output force through leverage. Understanding where we can apply this model to the human world can be a source of great success.

<br>Alloying - zliatina
<br> the alloy can be far stronger than the simple addition of elements
<br>This process leads us to engineer great physical objects, but we understand many intangibles in the same way; a combination of the right elements in social systems or even individuals can create a 2+2=6 effect similar to alloying.

<br>Had a dream where kawai looked me to find someome new. Finally i did a black girl (she lost an eye and we all three travelled to slovakia). 
<br>Made me think why kawai told me to look for someone new.
<br>The answer is because we dont see ourself seriously and dream assumes never will.
<br>&_
<br>We are together because we love each other, support each other. Unclear whats next
<br> -> breakup in future. Not force to find it out, find what everyone agrees.

<br>Work backwards. 
<br>&_ 
<br>Not about suggesting a vision. Understanding what we want.
<br>No due, do deadlines. Either can be found out or not. Thw fact is we havent found that. Maybe not matured for that discussion. I havent seen that in this way.
<br>- 
<br>Do not think of getting married. Think of next step. Are you ready to settle?

<br>Knew we need this discussion, but didnt know how

<br>You can read about origin of the number 666 but foremost about the end of the world. If you're interested, script prorokuje 7 rán. The last one will be the fatal.
<br>This book differs from the rest by the style of writing. Its supposed to be scary. It reads fast, it's very visual and metaphors about angels spilling kalich of Gods anger on Earth causing disasters will boost your imagination.
<br>Every time i read the bible i am trying to think what would people living 500 years ago think when they heard the same words.

<br>You have a sociql system defined by strong internal bonds between its members. Individual makes contributions only if feels being trusted and supported by others.
<br>Serving in a church is a mission, not a job. If you live with something on your past, how would you feel being thrown away would impact on your social status?
<br>What if number of other people with stains on their past is so significant, that their sacrification would destroy any bonds within your organisation?
<br>So here's the point. Sacrification of your own members would weaken bonds which would led to collapse of your social system. Secondly, would you allow someone from outside to destruct it?
<br>If you step back in the most serious cases you weaken your position and allow your enemies to graduate their demands.x

<br>What trully motivates me in what i do is to create value for someone. Eitjer at Lalamove, or in freelancing. I also have an acvount on instagram where i share photo. Im all cases its about creatimg something. In first two, solvong problems, in third inspiring others.
<br>In the end of the day what really matters is things get done.
<br>Ideashave no value if you cant execute them. Hours spent on meeting and research too.
<br>Execution.

<br>
<br>What you can learn from freelancing
<br>1 you are the only one who is responsible for execution - you need to figure out hiw to get things done, what you need for that and get others to help you. This teaches  you independece and be confident.
<br>2 do only things that matter and in the most effecient way - you are paid to figure out whats best solution for client and get it done. If you do that faster you get your final payment earlier and have more time for leiserure or you can take on new gigs. Whats more likely to happen is that things need to take longer. Much longer. If you thought it would take a week, it will be a month. If you fail in managing yourself and others you need to sacrifise time spenr wirhyour closed ones, your leisure time and your profit. Learn to get strictly disciplined - avoid distractions, and get maximum of work in the shortest time. dont waste it on things that are not needed.
<br>#
<br>I have my daily design job at a tech company, besides that I work on freelance gigs and share my photos on Instagram. What truly motivates me is creating value for someone.
<br>First two cases are about solving problems, and third one, the photography, is to inspire others.
<br>What they have in common is that in the end of the day, what truly matters is the execution.
<br>I've got two rules which I apply to my daily life.
<br>1 - The Law of multiplication by zero: it tells something obvious - any number multiplied by zero equals zero. In real life your effort can be eliminated by weakest parts of the system. Your ideas have no value if they stay only in your head. Working on your projects creates no value if they get stuck somewhere on the half way. Sometimes it has more sense to work on zeros to increase the outcomes. 
<br>2 - Maximize the impact. Given the limited resources, how can your work make maximal value? 
<br>Make every minute count. Besides daily job I have 1-2 hour a day for freelancing. In this time I need to do a work which would normally take me a day.
<br>There is also other way how you can think of this - what is the smallest effort added to to top of the work you have done that would increase its outcome? Share your experiences. Inspire others. If you're learning a new skill, keep sharing your progeess. This can make you more commited you your goal. You may receive new inputs or unlock new opportunities. Though you may think this is not your cup of tea. If  you're an introvert like me there's a new challenge - put on your extrovert hat and try it.
<br>-
<br>-
<br> Turn negatives into advantages.  You can focus on execution - given the time and other constrains you have - how can you and given the constrains you have Think of that in this way. If you work on something,

<br>Elliot. 
<br>Last week was a Chinese New Year. To me , as a Westerner living in Hong Kong it  came like a free weekend in the middle of the week. I did a lot of creative work as I was working on my freelance gig - a website for a small music agency from France based in Hong Kong. 
<br>The brief was tough. Although the website was fairly simple, there were no visual assets available so I could work only with text. This made it really challenging to achieve elegant and professional look which would also resonate in the industry.
<br>I thought the core of the work will be done when I finish the layout. I was wrong. The page delivered the message about the client, but it looked so empty. I asked myself, how would this convince a potential customer?
<br>Sometimes it's really difficult to make simple things. You can come across plenty of overstyled websited which are tiring ypur eyes.
<br>The hardest lesson I learnt was that all elements, styles, decorations and effects need to come only when they are really necessary. 
<br>If you want to implememt some subtle effects to respond on users interactions, its ok if they are truly needed.
<br>Adding more colors to page is also fine if that's the only way to add more life.
<br>If you want to introduce more text styles, do that as long as there is a clear value to the user.
<br>Every single detail I made made me think how much it would help user before I decided to implement it.
<br>Start oversimplified and carefully plan adding more. Stop when you think nothing more is needed. Never start from the other end. Always think of people for whom the page is built. They will use it. What do you want to make them think?
<br>This is fascinating about freelancing. There is always a lot of to learn with each project.
<br>#..
<br>+++
<br>Ok, let's fix it - how about bringing more life by using external photos? to google some photos or illustrations that could be added there?
<br>I quickly refused to use assets from open sources because they give no value to the visitor. Only assets appropriate would be those provided by client which I didn't have
<br>+++
<br>-
<br>I want to share my work with you. The website is still far for being done. There is a lot of work on branding and interactions remainging. You can check it lullabytunes.co - feel free to share your feedback
<br>##...
<br>-
<br>- Add colors to separate sections.
<br>-
<br>The challenge was to bring life to plain text sections and meke the page resonate in its industry.

<br>Chess games are fascinating. Both players start from the same position and the final result depends how they can align their figures to reach their goal.
<br>Chinese checkers is a chess game where you need to move your marbles to your opponent's home before he or she moves their marbles to yours. 
<br>My winning strategy is to get your marbles closest to opponentent to block their moves. You'll fail if you don't move faster than your opponent.
<br>The most effective tactics to gain control over the game do not make sense to random observer. They seem stupid in their beginning. They seem as a waste of moves. But they are smart. Soon they bring you their advantage and make you unstoppable. 
<br>Your moves may seem silly to other people. But at some situations that's the only way to get to your goal.

<br>Its a vision of helping them make critical decisions about their businesses.
<br>Powerful analytics tool, that goes way beyond tracking logistics data. I want to help them make strategies, plan marketing campaigns and operations. 
<br>See where their customers are what
<br>Secondly, logistics is a part of the process and has huge impact on customer reputation and clients reputation. Currently there is no visibility into quality.
<br>Why they cannot see how recepients see their orders? What are the most problematic orders?
<br>Help them grow their businesess - dont have answer why. Think how ad camlaigns help you shape your marketing. - understand demographics of cuatomers

<br>If hou control categorisation and rankings, you control how people use them and what they think.
<br>Categories - assuming how things work. Wrong category - confusion, missed opportunity
<br>Modern art - reaction on thousands years of arts. Now we have cameeas why dont need to paint to make it look like a photograph was taken. 
<br>Categories no longer matter - crowdsourced labeling - infinite categories. Thanks to technology you can directly get to things you are looking for.
<br>Putting someone to category does no longer matter - output what you can see matters more. You dont look for birds to find animals that can fly. You want to look for flying animals (squirrels)

<br>Sometimes you just feel down. It can be caused by an embarrasing moment that's still in your fresh memory. Maybe you acted bad at certain situation or feel others mistreated you.
<br>Everytime I feel down I use a following trick. I ask myself, how would i acted, if this was the most awesome day of my life? How would I look if I made a million today? 
<br>If you're walking on the street, no one needs to see how you really feel. 
<br>Confidence is an ability to convince others to see you how you want them to see.
<br>If you feel down it's because it's your choice. If you can't get over it you may keep yourself from opportunities that can restore your inner mood.

<br>I am terrible at communication. When I want to express something that I really care I almost always fail. I suddenly stop in the middle of the sentence. I feel like my brain stops working and my mind goes blank. There are no more words coming. There's just void. Its like when a city gets blackout. 
<br>Believe me, it has caused me many embarrassing moments.
<br>On the other side, simetimes my mind can become bright and extremely creative. It generates one idea after another. I immediately start writing them down. I grab pen and paper or open note taking app - whatever is closest to me. It's so fast that I can hardly keep the pace.
<br>These moments come spontaneously. They always walk in quietely. If I open myself to them they can turn into a massive flow of inspiration.
<br>#
<br><br>
<br>The best ideas and the best creative work are always triggered by something. There is always some level of discomfort before they are born and developed.
<br>If you dont feel dissatisfaction or frustration during your process, you probably don't get the best out of you.

<br>One of the things that freelancing tought me was to aim for viable solutions.
<br>Time needed to bring value to the client can be defined by a curve.
<br>When your work reaches certain level of quality, the more further time you invest, the smaller additional value you can deliver.
<br>Client wants the best results possible, but doesn't have budget to overpay you. If you spend too much time on developing ykur work, you wont be in profit.

<br>Seth Godin. Self-publishing books
<br>- Share your thoughts with your audience, you will get their trust and credibility
<br>- Do the emotional labor that brings book in format that people want to touch that teaches them what you want to teach.
<br>- do the work of sharing your ideas - publish a blog post each day with no cost. Charging for book - its nice to make living by something you care about.
<br>If someone buys your idea, they treat it with morr respect. They focus more energy on that. Comes in different package
<br>- dont keep track on bestsellrrs, it doesnt matter
<br>- start promoting your ideas 3 years before it comes out. You need to build the permission asset and credibility, so when it comes people will buy it.
<br>- buying a book by cover sends same message as buyng shoes - buyng a bood sboes makes you better than you are. People will judge you.
<br>- you dont do that for everyone, you do that for someone.

<br>Každé rano sa učím hrať na ukulele.
<br>Deň 1 bol hrozný.  Každé ucho, čo ma počulo hrať, trpelo. Dnes je to už lepšie.
<br>Jedného dňa budem chodiť po lúkach, hrať na svoje ukulele a spievať piesne, ktoré budú robiť ľudí šťastnými.
<br>Niečo podobné ako robil Paul McCartney v klipe Mull of Kintyre.
<br><br>
<br>I started learning to play ukulele.
<br>Every morning I make a cup of milk tea and practise.
<br>My Day 1 was terrible. The music was so bad tgat every ear that heard it suffered and wished me to stop.
<br>Today it's much better.
<br>One day I will walk through meadows, play my ukulele and sing songs that make people happy.
<br>Something like Paul McCartney does in his clip for Mull of Kintyre.

<br><br>
<br>I like pushing myself into situations which bring me some level of challenge. Although I may feel anxious about them, I see them as an opportunity to try new disciplines and skills.
<br>I say yes if someone asks me to give a public speech, recently I started dancing and learning to play on ukulele in 3 weeks (I said yes to make a performance in front of 300 people).
<br>The more I am doing that, the more I feel comfortable with starting something new or adapting myself to changing conditions.

<br><br>
<br>Ak som niečomu naozaj nepochopil, tak je to ako niektoré reštaurácie robia čaj s tak krémovou chuťou. Mne sa rovnaká chuť dosiahnuť nepodarila a nebudem odpočívať, dokiaľ sa nepodarí.x

<br>Be more active in research
<br>Dont want to see myself as an executioner
<br>Wanto get closer to end users, hear their
<br>I cannot do execution well if all information i work woth comes throu at least 3 people
<br>Extract information from talking to them pain, thats really motivates me
<br>- shorten paths, find hacks - standard research too slow
<br>More research to make, higher confidence
<br><br>
<br>Failure must always be a lesson, not be seen as dead end
<br>Learning from failires is the only way to succeed. Dont let your mistales be a reason why your desire to move forward decreases.
<br>Its a good thing if you take it as an exeriemce what not to do any more

<br>You are trying to allocate resources. you cannot cannibalise more urgent tasks, Treat yourself as two persons - a contractor and client. As a contractor you want to spend maximal time, but as a client you can offer only limited timeslots, because you are occupied with another tasks. - negotiate with yourself fair amount of time you need to get satksfying progress.

<br>We didnt give you all information you need .
<br>Think what do you need to understand problem.
<br>- i dont want us to take pencils and start drawing.
<br>- i want us to work on understanding the problem and exploring ways to solve it.
<br><br>
<br>Focus on making user find value
<br>++Dont translate your ideas to solutions
<br>++Think of examples from offline world. How are they solved?
<br><br>
<br>Dont offer solutions for the sake of purpose of thisnsession. This os not a hackatlon.

<br>- there is no reason preventong you from booking truck for sending a box of chocolate
<br><br>
<br>Weaknesses
<br>- quantity
<br>- categorization
<br>-
<br>- you need to go to the airport, need to urgently send something before you send
<br>-
<br>++I need to know how users who use that understand that.
<br>What do i need to understand problem better?
<br>++ Show you understand you understand users and if you dont feel confident to say that. Figure out how to manage that.
<br>- 
<br>Outcomes: ai + find your item in top results. Otherwise not. Gonna work. Ecoerce, google

<br>How do you know you can give user the best service?
<br>Giving options is normal. Help them to understand them

<br>Think of ourselves as a social platform.
<br>You are not the only person whos using this.
<br>There are thousanfs of other people sharing the same problems.
<br>-
<br>Show your thinking. Step out from this room, atep out from problem. Come up with something that no one thinks of. 
<br>Ask yourselves - what is the most human way of solving this
<br>-
<br>I see ourselved as a social platforom. Interactions are social. What are we doing for that?
<br>-
<br>How do you see LLM?
<br>-
<br>Whats our philosophy. Think about this before you start solving any problem?
<br>-
<br>We are looking for right tinking that solves this problem.
<br>Focus on philosophy shows solution. If we can do that we will be able to solve even bigger probls easilly.
<br>Think of what is Lalamove. What is an opportunity to do things like no one else
<br>-
<br>I wamt to chamge format of this session. Before you start I wamt you to think about these questions
<br>1. What is Lalamove? Should be
<br>2. What defines it?
<br>- its all about how you see it.
<br>I want to find a philosophy 
<br>3 ways of matching solutions to problems
<br>1. Direct
<br>2. Step back, look how others do that, find patterns.
<br>3. Define approach/thinking/ philosophy - this is who we are, this is how we do things - which will show only ways how to do that.
<br>Technically all can ve correct
<br>This is Not about finding correct one, its about finding/identifying right ones.
<br>- if this is done, you will be able to solve not only this one, but even bigger problems and with simpicity and elegance.
<br>I am doing this because this is what we're missing. We are looking only for technically correct solutions, not thinking DEEPER.
<br>-
<br>This is how i see it ...given that, this is a direction that makes sense to me. - but these are two different things. 
<br>I dont see anything wrongbqbout the option (sometimes it works, somewhere it creates friction), its more about how you communicate that.
<br>Games - learn everything within first 4 levels.
<br>What are our values.
<br>Lets not only look for solutions that are technically correct, but think if they are inline with some values.
<br>--
<br>Think what are our values, whays our philosophy.
<br>These questions can quide you.
<br>-
<br>3. How do you want to be seen?
<br>-
<br>We wanted to take this as a creative session.
<br>-
<br>If we are unable to figure out whats our driving force,...
<br>-
<br>Social platform - what do we do for that? How do you know that driver is the best choice for you.
<br>I have seen huge disappointments. As a client you have no power before it gets too late.
<br>- 
<br>This is the current solution that causes problem.
<br>----
<br>1 You can never solve it for every single problem. But fixing 20 most common cases will fix 80problems
<br>2 how do you make someone feelthat yhis platform truly cares about people. Give human touch?
<br>"People choose this for..."
<br>-
<br>You may agree with philosophy, but you may argue its not possible because of interface limits.
<br>-
<br>What solutiins we want
<br>- 
<br>How do you want to define brand? Its more tgan a styleguide and library
<br>-
<br>If you talk about error states - describe system behavior or make empathy.
<br>You cannot pay the driver vs low balance

<br>- intuitive and discoverable design
<br>- in first level you teaches you how to play.

<br>Do the same in design
<br>- use minimal set of elements
<br>- give feeling of accomplishment. Or at least not make feel negative

<br>I started learning to play on ukulele. 3 weeks ago I commited myself to perform in front of 400 people. Never held ukulele in hands before and have no experience with playing an musical instrument.
<br>I did that for two things:
<br>1 I like pushing myslef to situaitions that cause me some leveldiscomfort. I found its the most effective way to learn new things and stretch your comfort zone
<br>2 research shows that playing on musical instrument boosts your brain activity. Measuring brain activity of pleople playing musical instruments shows there are literally fireworks happening in their brains. When you play its like a workout for your brain. Now I find myslef more creative and confident.
<br>My perfomance is this Friday. Although I thought i am not capable of playing ukulele, everybody can learn to play a few songs in a month with a proper guidance.

<br>1 referral and coaching program
<br>2  own incentives
<br>3 3rd parties incentives and loyalty programs
<br>4 personalized and predivtive on individual level
<br>You DONT NEED TO spend your own money on challenged
<br>We can open the same engine to 3rd parties to spend their own money incentivize drivers - brands and business can build loyal community of drivers - (lotalty programs) i will fight to take kfc, because they will pay me extra for good rating
<br>Personalized campaigns - build on behavior of similar drivers - take two more orders before you wrap up
<br>Marketing engine.  Build for ondemand campaigns. You can hardcode partd which dont move often. But Dont do any shortcuts. Will create tech and design debt which will hit you painfully one day. 
<br>Build for future problems, not present problems.
<br>-
<br>Challenges + Analytics
<br>Go to analytics, check your delivery data and there is a tip - hey, businesses like you are engaging drivers through challenges. Go to Challenge manager and we will tell you how to set up your first challenge.
<br>Once you lauch you can return to Analytics to track.
<br>We rewarded our drivers and our deliveries got delivered faster.
<br>Here's what mathematics say: if everybody os using that to take advamtage, you have to too.
<br>If you make enough people to use something what gis them advanfage, you force others to use it too
<br>If you come to casino and everybody is buying extra chips, you have to too, because your betting power would be weaker.
<br>-
<br>Everytime when you can target to a group ofpeopleyou can find a way to monetize that. When you can find a specific type people, you can also find someonewho has a message for them . 
<br>This is qhat we are already doing. I have a box, who wants to deliver it to...?

<br>Referrals - focus on operation - save money
<br>Marketing - focus on innovation - creating a new business - create money
<br>-
<br>There is a referral program.
<br>On top of it there is an engine, which takes a message and find people who will see it.
<br>On right there is an analytics which tells you how it went.
<br>-
<br>This is an idea for business plan that works in any emvironment.
<br>If you can build a tech that can be plugged to any type of data and can target them and deliver any type of task and you can measure how effective it is, you can start a company.o

<br>20 time burnt on feedback loop - exporting to another tool, documenting work, so another people can review + many limits that cannot be solver
<br>Actual design work takes only 20 percent of my time - time is gwtting even more precious. To keep the pace, i need to think how can i reduce those small 20 percent.
<br>I have used figma on some tasks with admin panel - speed work, zro time handoff, no information is lost on handoff, dev see waht designer does.
<br>I can keep up the same pace only if i use figma.
<br>Downside - fragments design work, workflow problem, this tool is really taking off, i see it all across community and use it for freelancing,.
<br>Sketch is already building same collaboration tools, comes too late
<br>other side - lifetime of design is very short, the older it gets, more it needs to be changed. 30 percent sites need complete redesign.
<br>It doesmt matter where you store your work, what matters more is how fast you are.

<br>- i am not satisfied with our workflow.
<br>As a result I am not disciplined in compling some tasks.

<br>Lot of tike spent on handoff+documemting, not useful at all.
<br>#
<br>- i wanted to open a discussion
<br>- either sacrifice productivity or teamwork
<br>- like relationship single vs taken - if you think there's somethine thats bemeficial for teamwork, its fair to bring that up to table
<br>- --
<br>I took it from wrong end.
<br>Never ever make the same mistake.
<br>I started talking about the solution and then  moved on to problem.
<br>People rejected my solution and didnt listen to the problem.
<br>To do instead: talk about problem, make sure they understand and agree. Ask if you see it too. - or whoever else. Never translate to solution immediately if they dont understa d problem. They wont the solution tool
<br>-
<br>Valudate problems (w engineers). Show how to solve, do not show solution
<br>- 
<br>Tools that we use always limit communication, thats either missing or another effort is needed 
<br>-
<br>Need guidelines, no matter what i do will not solve ptoblem. Will be unclear, hard to follow.
<br>Not obly my call - they have their say too. Any tool is ineffective if you dont use it properly - ask them to show you examples of what works
<br>- otherwiae problems would remain
<br>--
<br>Any problem is solvable with right thinking
<br>#
<br>--
<br>Ask on ideal handoff tool- how do you want to receuve designs, what do you need to read, what you think, qhat you saw elsewhere
<br>-
<br>Andrew: i think design-dev workflow is far from ideal, 
<br>Communication, principles, rules to follow
<br>there is a lot of ineffeciencies,
<br>Want to talk to you to find imprivements
<br>- coordinate design and dev.
<br>---
<br>Asked to create some rules, they dont know how.
<br>- what should i do? Create a page in confluence? Another wiki? Add more notes to library?
<br>Whats root cause - no design-dev intersection. No one ever asked me on something, but i saw things wrong
<br>More openness - you get access to library, you show me how you use it.

<br>Religion. God.
<br>-
<br>Religion and Spirituality are two diffefent things.
<br>To understand spirituality need to define religion.
<br>Focal point of religion is God.
<br>In past, peiple paintef it as a human character positioned far in the skies. It wasnt clear but message was delivered.
<br>Why wrong 
<br>-
<br>Tangible
<br>Centralized
<br>-
<br>Concept - think of it as a force. Its not concentrared only on one place.
<br>Its not only in skies, its around you. In air, under ground, far beyound atmosphere, it fills all space known and unknown to you.
<br>It existed for always and cannot be disappear.
<br>Physicist - calls it energy. Says its  everywhere around you, all things are made from  it. Its existed since .. and cannot be destroyed. He adds changes its forms
<br>-
<br>They both are trying to understand it, how it impacts their luves, understanf law of tge attraction.

<br>When you're in restaurant, would you get the best food by ordering a signature dish? I think you shouldn't trust restaurants recomendations.
<br>If you are a restaurant, the more people order your recommeded dishes, the higher is your temptation to please more people by averaging the taste.
<br>What it means to you is, that you can discover richer tastes by trying not recommended items in the menu.
<br>To bring this into different light, sometimes you can get better outcomes by not following what everybody else does.

<br>I was scared after I heard: we found something on your lungs. We don't know what it is and we need to keep you here for a few days. How can life get such twitst that you end up thinking if you are here next week?

<br>When I left the airport I went directly to work. It was very exhausting and when i came home I was already awake for 30 hours. The next day was another busy work day. On the next day I started feeling unwell.

<br>Zakaždým, keď sa pozerám na svoj napuchnutý členok, hovorím si, že horšie to už byť nemôže. Zakaždým sa presvedčím, že dá sa to.
<br>Dnes mi noha napuchla ako čižma a už nedokážem ani chodiť.

<br>There is a movie with Roberto Benigni called Life is Beautiful. Its about man and his son who are detained to a WWII concentration camp. Soon after their arrival the child has questions abput where they are and what's going on around them. The man hides the true situation tells him its all a game. If you perform given tasks, you will get a reward - to see a tank.
<br>Until the liberation the child believes its a game and finally it sees an American tank which enters the camp.

<br>My Cantonese has inproved since i started practising a learning method called M&N. The method says, you should study for 20 mins in tye morning and 20 mins before sleeping (Morning&Night)
<br>Every morning I go through new topics and write down notes on a sheet of paper.
<br>At night, I go through my morning notes and  rewrite them to my phone. When I am in bed I read my notes from brain amd repeat what i want to learn before I fall asleep.
<br>The best way for learning Cantonese is through grammar and pronounciation. Howtostudycantonese is a great resource.
<br>Last but not least - every time when you study always set your learning goal - what are the 1-2 things you want to learn today a remember them even after a month?

<br>I was sitting in a room woth another 100 people. Most of them were high ranked executives. I was asked to tell about any professional or personal problem that worries me the most.
<br>I took it very personally. I said hat sometimes I feel my communication skills are poor. Sometimes I feel that my mind is blank and I cannot get the right words on my tongue to express myself. Sometimes I feel that I my wordpower is narrow and I am using the same set of words over and over in my daily communication.
<br>Other people asked the same question were talking vaguely about problems related to their work.  
<br>I also said that I want to tell stories that people remember. Without realising that, I succeeded. No one remembers what other people said, but I received many responses on my answer from people who heard it. Some still remembered it even months after  I said that
<br>Stories that resonate must be more than personal. They must bleed from your heart. They must be so intimate that you would be shy to tell them to the closest person you have. 
<br>People remembered my answer because I wasn't the only one who has such feelings.
<br>This lesson can be taken further. The best creative work is work that steps out from crowd. It must have something that scares you to publish.
