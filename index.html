<br>Novoročný Hovor so Smaďom do Podhájskej.
<br><br>
<br>Hike to Suicide Cliff.
<br><br>
<br>Started reading a new book.
<br>First thing it made me think about was that whenever there is a disruption caused by more empathic system, existing leaders tend to protect their market until they miss the wave (personal computing, digital cameras, music streaming, ride sharing, Airbnb)
<br><br>
<br>Ľudia sa boja robiť zložité zmeny.
<br>Radšej chcú byť lepší o 5 percent o mesiac ako o 500 percent o 5 rokov.
<br>Prvá cesta je responzívna - riešiť problémy, ktoré sú predo mnou, druhá proaktívna - budovať vecí, ktoré neexistujú
<br>Len veľmi málo ľudí myslí dlhodobo.
<br>--
<br>iPhone release - Microsoft laughing, it has no keyboard
<br>Would you recognize disruption?

<br>Hike to Suicide Cliff.
<br>V pláne je aj vrátiť sa naspäť
<br><br>
<br>-There we go. 2020!
<br><br>
<br>I use Instagram as a tool to improve my photography skills. The only way is through keeping consistency and raising quality bar.
<br>To ensure that I set a goal for 2019 - to reach 500 posts on @mareksiv and @letoslav.
<br>This is my 2019 report
<br>Mareksiv 161
<br>Letoslav 338
<br>Total: 499
<br>Goal for 2020:
<br>500 posts; not one less!
<br><br>
<br>Krajiny, ktoré som navštívil v 2019, zoradené podľa dĺžky pobytu
<br>Hong Kong

<br>Error state handling.
<br>Levi, want to follow up on discussion on hike - I wonder when system is down if we offer any empathetic way to inform user
<br>-offline logic to handle that
<br>-when system uˇis down how to we tell that user in apps - any error state or just infinite lodaer
<br>--
<br>How can user easily detect
<br>--
<br>Show empathy withusers when system is down
<br>-show them in a warm way we understand inconveniences we caused - do more than Try again later
<br>-needs to be an offline logic we hich handles states when app cannot connect to system.
<br>-shared properly implemented(empty states are commonly as default, overlaid with data after loaded - that's wrong and lazy implementation)
<br>-use aniˇation (eg driver waiting on red light) - need to come to the scene at when high confidence system is down - cannot be misused
<br>-help user inform when system is back - link to status page
<br>—
<br>Scale this logic . Multiply in other instances to ceeate a new generatoon of emathetic communication with customer

<br>The smallest thing that brought an overwhelming outcome I did in 2019 was to uninstall Facebook app from my phone.
<br>Soon after I did that, I found out that I've got much more free time. I have more time in the morning, in the evening before going to bed and I finish my meals faster.
<br>I invest saved time into reading.

<br>We’ve got an offer on desk from Grab to buy operations (customer base, not the app)
<br>A: That guy believes he can build something in China and export it to the world.
<br>Whats stopping you from that? 
<br>Why you’re keeping your office in Hong Kong?
<br><br>
<br>That you are hongkonger and your company is local - from Hong Kong
<br><br>
<br>Because you are sentimental. Not because you are stupid, but because you are human
<br>B: That guy wants to focus on building business in China. Why else yould you launch a new app which can be easily rebranded?
<br>How would you feel to become a product manager at Grab?

<br>I talked to engineers and they confirmed me there is no proper way to handle outage states
<br><br>
<br>Airtable bases 
<br>Rather than finding right answer let's have some rules which will lead to desired state and enforce them
<br>1. Set up ownership - whenever there is unclear ownership upon things, they become unmaintained
<br>-each base has an owner. If you need a base for your work, you are an owner and you are responsible for maintaining it. 
<br>-If you are owner you put your name on things you own. 
<br>-Each base has only one owner. If there is multiple people using the same board, they decide who will be owner
<br>-if you are owner and don't find your base useful for yourself any more, you can archive it
<br>-if you are owner and you don't find base useful for yourself any more but someone else does, you transfer ownership (and that person becomes an owner)
<br>-if no one claims ownership over a base, it will be archived
<br>-if you are owner you are responsible for bases you own. Bases you own are accessible for everyone and as an owner you need to make sure everyone can understand and use its data (eg documentation, consistent terminology and structure)
<br>-as an owner you work with other owners to make sure your boad is well documented, uses consistent terminology and structure
<br>-as an owner you are not only responsible for mastering your bases but you need to make sure these rules are applied to all bases
<br>--
<br>Same thinking which is applied for everyone
<br>Investigate root problem, not do what you are asked for - how to maintain bases
<br>Propose system that handle that with low effort and scales up easily - handle 3 boards as easy as 100 transferrable to another systems

<br>Tam som končil aj minulý týždeň, tentokrát na inom mieste, bližšie k vrcholu. Dĺžka bola ďaleko dlhšia ako naposledy a strmých úsekov bolo niekoľkonásobne viac a väčšinou brutálne dlhé.

<br>Its a great improvement and I like your approch of pushing things live instead of perfecting on staging. I would be careful about blemishes in UI. Although its a minor thing compared to the scope of the update, when interface doesnt look or behave as user expects, it can undermine trust. On mobile I saw some components leaving too much white space on left or duplicated images in marketing pages.
<br>Product updates can be zero cost opportunity to engage community and get extrenal inputs

<br>Meditation and prayer help maintain a healthy spirit. Spirit is not a ghost—it is your inner person or inner being. Yes, your spirit is as real as YOU and if you don’t believe it, try this:
<br>*What happens when someone dies? What is it that departs from a person?*
<br>The person’s life—right?
<br>That’s what I mean. I know some people will disagree, but that is a story for another day.
<br>Anyway, meditation and prayer builds a healthy spirit and increases your faith, which in turn builds a healthy mind, which builds a healthy body.

<br>-When you ask questions you are thinking about the problem

<br>Playing ukulele this morning.
<br>Obervoming a huge bias set by brain - ulyou use two hands simultaneously. Left hand presses chords and ringh one does strumming. What brain does. When you mess up a chord, it pulls emergency break and everything stops until you fix it. You need to teach your brain that right hand plays independently from left hand. If left hand messes up a chord, right one keeps strumming. 
<br>It’s learning a new skill and there is a capacity in your brain you need to unlock to achieve that.

<br>First of all: i found it difficult to work on flows. We were focused on interfaces and this was distracting from understanding reslations between them - uis like expedition, booking, something what happens next, profiles, likes, discussions, and other exciting parts we have discussed seemed as isolted nodes floating in vacuum.
<br>I found to find it difficult to explain value of pages we are working on - its because we are focused to much on appearance. To be able to see connections we need to change the way we see them
<br>To build a world class product we need to see motivations and needs of the customer first. Inferfacws are nothing more than their reflection, not the other way around.
<br>Because of lack of connection Traditional process for building flows doesnt work for this - takes our attention to interfaces - when we see user browsing expeditions - we tend to forrget what brought them there
<br>Difficult to be explain particular stages on user flow
<br>Created states of commectedness
<br>-all flows are related. Places like booking page, prifile, - want to go are states on a bigger picture - you cannot think of one without considering others
<br>To remind that oursleves - we are not using There is no longer a booking page. We are no longer taking about dxpddition page
<br>There is only a state of connectedness - there are 5 degrees from inspire to pride - challenge is how to take customers to the final state
<br>When we are thinking a page to list out expeditions - we should always ask why we are doing that. How does this help user to move to the next state
<br>What we call Booking is a interface to convey that state
<br><br>
<br>What empathy are we using - any idea should be challenged by questioning
<br><br>
<br>We can succeed if we master every single stage

<br>Give people option to become 1 percent better tomorrow or 10k in year

<br>Why?
<br>-adaptivity. Second path tales more risk: requires handling tougher tasks, getting skills and knowlesge we dont have
<br>-I have dofferent habits in HK and SK. Its like I’ve got two personalities sith their own routines and habits and I am switching between them. I couldnt bring my Slovak personality to HK, it would be too costly, so I left it there and created an new one which is adopted to a new environment. 
<br>I found many people wouldnt be able to do that and they wouldnt be able to live on different place for a longer time
<br>-working long term means adapting to conditions that do not exist. Means thinking and living in new ways, dropping your old self - thats why its so problematic for many.

<br>Už Thúkydidés si všiml, že země obklopené mořem se v mnoha ohledech liší od pevninských mocností. Klasickým příkladem takových států byly Sparta a Athény. Athény čerpaly svou sílu z obchodu a řemesel, Sparta z tradičního rolnictví. Z geografických a ekonomických rozdílů vyplývaly i rozdíly politické a kulturní. Athény byly otevřenou demokracií cenící si individuální svobody, Sparta naproti tomu kolektivistickou a konzervativní oligarchií. Toto schéma se mělo opakovat po celé dějiny a jeho posledním příkladem byla rivalita mezi přímořskými Spojenými státy a pevninským Sovětským svazem.

<br>Tento boj trvá podnes. Kulturní hodnoty spojené s Pevninou jsou ohrožovány ideály Moře.

<br>Jestliže Rusko nedokáže ovládnout celý kontinent, a vše nasvědčuje tomu, že nedokáže, bude muset udělat vše pro to, aby Eurasie na západě hraničila se spřáteleným blokem vedeným Německem. Polsko se tak musí rozhodnout pro vstup do ruské nebo německé sféry zájmů, v opačném případě na ně čeká tentýž osud jako obvykle. „Středoevropská civilizace je příliš slabá na to, aby vydržela napětí mezi Východem a Západem. Země tohoto regionu se musejí jasně rozhodnout: buďto tam, nebo tam. Polsko-litevská civilizace se nedokázala nebo nemohla jasně vyslovit, proto musela zmizet. Je to samozřejmě dramatická situace.

<br>Goal should be to provide the simplest way to expess how amazing foundlost expeditions are
<br>Rethink medium - what is the most convenient way to create and consume?
<br>Think of audiobooks, podcasts vs printed books - skipping -> extraction, get to points of interest
<br>Export meaningful parts
<br>Lets create inspiring people - share their stories
<br>—expedition diary might be a way — to tell this is how expedition where I was part of went
<br>— needs to ve as simple as sharing photos — vidual diary —0ut some photos to each day — what photos reflect the entire expedition the most? — what were the highlishts?
<br>Start with CS and CH — ask him to pick photos that reflect the mood of the trip - design for emotionality, not rationality - and work with him to find the most capturing way of storytelling
<br>—later on, enable everyone to come and share their moments — great content validates standard of foundlost expeditions
<br>—Create a community sharing their stories. 
<br>Anyine can come and create their posts - you come to us give us your photos and se will help you to publish them in a stunning way you can share
<br>—we encourage you to post moments related to outdoor experiences, but not stopping you from posting about anything you want.  Warm Reminder, there is community and they might be in related posts - less related posts may receive less exposure - you need to start thinking of ramkings and segments to make sure right content will be delivered to right people. Not a concern for day 0

<br>In the middle of Wuhan Flu panic.
<br><br>
<br>Slovenská vláda je pri Wuhan Flu optimistická. Podľa ich stanoviska je všetko v pohode, je to vpodstate stále len chrípka, ľudia by mali cvičiť, jesť ovocie a vyhnú sa jej. Keby aj nie, tak žiadne prípravy sa nekonajú, takže by mali smolu.
<br><br>
<br>Celkom ma prekvapuje ako sa ten čierny mor v Európe zľahčuje
<br>Prirovnáva sa ku chrípke, fakty sa prekrúcajú tak, aby vírus vyznel miernejšie ako SARS.
<br>Bez akejkoľvek kritiky sa používajú čínske štatistiky - pri nich sa ľudia dohadujú, koľko núl treba k číslam, ktoré uvádzajú, dopísať (podľa niektorých modelov do dvoch týždňoch má byť nakazených 250k ľudí, oficiálne čísla uvádzajú vyše 1000, keď bol vírus v 10 krajinách a HK hlásil 60 podozrivých, Čína oficiálne okolo 80 - toľko k dôveryhodnosti)
<br>Celkovo sa vytvára dojem, že žiadna hrozba nehrozí a keby náhodou hej, Čína má situáciu pod kontrolou (kolujú videá z čínskych nemocníc, kde na to zomierajú ľudia ako muchy, príbehy o biedej až žiadna starostlivosti)

<br>Smaďo sa ma pýta na čínsky vírus:
<br>Predstav si vírus, v ktorom sa spájajú dve vlastnosti
<br>1. Je vysoko smrteľný a neexistuje naňho žiadna protilátka
<br>2. Veľmi ľahko sa prenáša z človeka na človeka. Stačí aby niekto vedľa teba zakašlal a hneď si chorý aj ty. Pri tomto víruse sa príznaky prejavia až po dvoch týždňoch, medzitým ho človek šíri okolo seba bez toho, že by o tom vedel
<br><br>
<br>Preto tá panika. Ďalšia vec, never oficiálnym číslam. Ľudia, čo to sledujú,  sa hadaju koľko núl treba za ne dopísať. Podľa niektorých ľudí v teréne môže byť teraz nakazených štvrť milióna
<br><br>
<br>A to je o dosť viac ako tých pár tisícok čo sa uvádza. Jedna vec je, že nie všetky prípady sú hlásené. V Číne ich je toľko že nemajú kapacity každého ošetriť a ludi posielajú domov bez toho aby sa na nich niekto pozrel
<br><br>
<br>No a posledná vec na obavy je, ešte nikdy v histórii sa žiadny vírus nešírili tak rýchlo ako tento
